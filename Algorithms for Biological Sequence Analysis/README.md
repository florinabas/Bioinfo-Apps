Project description: 
- Implemented core bioinformatics algorithms for DNA/RNA processing, pattern detection, and basic genetic simulations, using problems from the Rosalind platform. Strengthened practical skills in sequence manipulation and algorithmic problem-solving relevant to genomic data analysis.

Steps:
- Wrote functions for nucleotide counting, DNA→RNA transcription, strand complement, and motif search.
- Calculated Hamming distance, translated RNA to protein, and built consensus/profile matrices.
- Simulated simple biological models (e.g. the rabbit recurrence problem).
- Implemented the Needleman–Wunsch global alignment algorithm to compare DNA/protein sequences using customizable match, mismatch, and gap penalties.

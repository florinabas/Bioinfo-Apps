Project description: 
- Developed and applied stochastic and probabilistic models to study biological sequences and genetic data. Combined Markov chains, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Monte Carlo simulations, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to simulate processes, predict hidden states, and estimate biological parameters such as nucleotide distributions and ABO blood group allele frequencies.

Steps:
- Markov and HMM Modeling: Defined model properties, built transition and emission matrices, simulated DNA sequence evolution, and applied the Viterbi algorithm to identify coding regions.
- Random Walk Simulations: Explored 1D and 2D stochastic processes to understand sequence dynamics and probabilistic behavior.
- Monte Carlo Simulations: Generated random samples using inverse CDF and direct sampling to simulate target probability distributions.
- Gibbs Sampling & MCMC: Implemented Gibbs sampling for multivariate distributions, analyzed effects of correlations and initial values, and estimated posterior distributions of allele frequencies in ABO blood groups using Bayesian methods.
- Bayesian Analysis & Inference: Defined priors and likelihoods, ran simulations in R and WinBUGS, and interpreted marginal and stationary distributions for reliable biological inference.
